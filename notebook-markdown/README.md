# Notebook Renderers - Markdown

This sample demostrates using the Notebook proposed APIs to render Markdown files as Notebooks.

## TODO
- Replace custom Markdown parsing with the [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) library

## BUGS
- Language compatibility: some Intellisense works, some don't.
- Search inconsistency: sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
